    content: "To fully receive the beneficial effects of music on exercise performance, take into consideration what type of activity you’ll be doing. Running for speed? Consider quicker songs with energizing beats. Calming your mind with a zen yoga flow? Press play on meditative music that helps you feel grounded. Mentally preparing for a sweaty HIIT or strength class? Choose songs that give you an emotional boost. And when you want to feel like a total rockstar, you can never go wrong with some Beyonce or Kendrick Lamar (in my opinion).",
